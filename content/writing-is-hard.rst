Writing is hard

(I apologize in advance, but this post is a bit rambling. It's not as pointy as
what I usually try to write.)

Writing, at least for me, is often *really hard*. If I don't know exactly what
I want to say already, I can't figure out what I want to say, let alone how I
want to say it! I'm trying to do `NaBloPoMo`_, the "National" Blog Posting
Month challenge. So I need to write a blog post every day. For 30. freaking.
days. Supposedly in high school I was supposed to learn some techniques on how
to write essays and soforth. Well, uh, apparently that didn't work out too
well. Even though I scored well on the AP English tests. My English teachers
throughout my past know that the struggle is real, though.

Another problem is that when I do think of something I might want to say, I
then do research into it. This usually leaves me with a good understanding of
whatever it is I want to know about. But, then, what is there to write about?
If you want to know about this thing, go read these things I read! I never
quite feel like what I have to say is any better than what has already been
said. Duplication of knowledge never seems terribly fruitful for me. Of course,
that's probably me being too hard on myself. Surely I have interesting, useful
things to say! Unfortunately I don't really have an audience in mind for my
blog, so it becomes difficult to tailor my writing very much. Right now I
pretty much just write for my mom and notes for myself.

I think I might just write about how I feel and what I think about, for a
while. That's much easier than any particular topic.
